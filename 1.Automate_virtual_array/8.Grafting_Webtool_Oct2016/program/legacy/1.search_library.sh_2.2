#function: searches LINK records in pdbs in MAIN_LIBRARY folder for the MOTIF defined by the motif_$i.txt files, which comes from the LINK.txt
#all structures in MAIN_LIBRARY with motif_1 are put into folder_1. motif_1 is a disacc
#structures in folder_1 with motif_2 are put into folder_2 and so on. motif_2 is the next dissacc in LINK
#Finally structures in last folder will contain all the motifs. 
#Connectivity between motifs may not be correct. it may just have all the correct disaccs. checked in next step

#output
#a folder containing all files in the library that contain all the disacc MOTIFS
