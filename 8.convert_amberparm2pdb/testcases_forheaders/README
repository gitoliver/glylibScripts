This directory has the test cases with which i tested the program for adding headers. 
There are three test cases test,test1,test2. 
The topology and coordinate files are used as input and the pdb files in the directory are the output files from the headers program. 
The program usually outputs a noh.pdb for the pdb with no hydrogens but i renamed them in this directory appropriately according to the test case names.

usage:

makeGlycomePDBxx input.top input.rst outputname.pdb
