#Background
tleap will automatically bond the tail atom of one residue to the head atom of the next residue. 
This causes problems with branched molecules such as N-linked glycans. 
To prevent this automatic bonding you can insert a TER card between the residues and then use a "bond" command in your leap input file to bond the correct atoms. 
I find the best way to automate this task is to insert TER cards between each carbohydrate residue and then use bond commands in leap. 
I generate these bond commands from the LINK cards present in the original glycan pdb file. 
Glycans generated on www.glycam.org/cb will contain LINK cards.

Instructions

1) Insert TER cards

Install pcregrep (e.g. sudo apt install pcregrep)
Open glycosylated.pdb, scroll to the bottom and note the first and last residue numbers of the glycan portion.
run insertTER.sh providing the first and last glycan residue numbers as well as the input pdb file 
e.g.

./insertTER.sh 445 643 glycosylated.pdb

2) Create bond commands for tleap

You can grep (or copy paste) the LINK cards into a separate files with:
grep "LINK.*" glycan.pdb > glycan.LINK

Use LINK2BOND.sh to convert the LINK cards to tleap bond commands:
e.g.

./multi-LINK2bond.sh resList glycan.LINK 445

Where 445 is the last protein residue number

Copy x.bond into your tleap input file.
